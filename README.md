 EcoDrop – The World’s First Marketplace for Sustainable Waste Assets
 Theme: Sustainable Business
 Project Overview
EcoDrop is a digital platform that turns waste into a tradable asset. Businesses and individuals can list
reusable waste materials (such as cloth scraps, wood cuttings, leftover food oil, packaging, etc.) for
others to purchase and repurpose. It creates a circular economy, reducing waste, saving resources,
and creating new revenue streams from “waste.”
This platform empowers local businesses, artists, recycling startups, NGOs, and students to reuse
discarded materials at low cost — while contributing to sustainability.
 How It Works
1. Sellers (factories, shops, restaurants, individuals) upload listings of reusable waste materials
with images, prices, and pickup details.
2. Buyers browse a marketplace of waste assets, filtered by category, location, material type,
etc.
3. They can request pickup or directly arrange local delivery.
4. Platform shows how much CO₂, water, or plastic was saved per transaction.
5. Both buyers and sellers get eco-points and badges for contributing to sustainability.
